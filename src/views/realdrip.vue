        <p class='rd-def par text-left'>
          FAIR believes that hunger in the midst of plenty has been one of the main problems confronting the African people and the element of lack had eroded one of one core value of integrity.
          <br><br>
          Although Africa is blest with a lot of natural resources, Africa and Africans have been seemingly condemned to famine and starvation making it possible for a few corrupt persons to ride on the ignorance of the people and further pushing them into need.
          <br><br>
          As s a solution therefore FAIR will institute agricultural practices in the communities, led and managed by the people themselves using modern farm production and distribution techniques.
          <br><br>
          FAIR will train elected leaders of the communities in modern agricultural practices, help them to acquire collective community held land trusts, supply them with equipments and inputs, access to finance and establish their distribution eliminating middle men and trade to achieve Fair-trade status.
          <br><br>
          This is the platform to promote the development of infrastructure agriculture and it diversification into agro industries and manufacturing to serve the community and export market.

        <p class='rd-def par text-left'>
          To achieve its aims and objectives, Foundation for African Integrity (FAIR) will set up Educational Institutions to offer education for the poor and needy of Africa and African decent and also offer specialized Training services for all members.
          <br><br>
          Teach a child the way he should grow, and when he grows he will not depart from it! FAIR sees Education as the power to unlock and unleash the potential of the African Youth, we will persistently seek and explore ways and means of providing quality and affordable education to the youth through the provision of schools, educational materials, teachers and bursaries and scholarships.
          <br><br>
          To realize the vision set out by the founding members of FAIR, we intend to provide specialized training to all members of FAIR through our Integrity School Of Thought program, a specialized training program designed to train members in the basic elements of integrity through practical experience.
          <br><br>
         Basic among them is our Integrity Personal Development Team Program (IPDTP), a 12 weeks program for all unemployed citizen both skilled and unskilled. IPDTP is designed to offer positive opportunities to develop young people’s confidence, motivation, communication and life skills by getting them to work as a team and complete project in their local community. For more information on our Education programs, please contact us at info@foundationforafricanintegrity.org

        <p class='rd-def par text-left'>
          Our research Department, conducting research into housing provision in Africa, concluded that housing was an indices in indexing poverty and deprivation in Africa. Over 85% of the population lives in structures that can be less referred to as shackles and huts as to houses let alone homes. This leaves a cycle of poverty in the path of the youth of Africa, since the growing within homelessness, creates a situation that will have damning consequences on their future if there is no intervention at some point in time.
          <br><br>
          That is why FAIR sees the need to encourage and support the average African to afford a decent house to call home. This noble goal has been prove probable and possible, by combining a little bit of external support, communal involvement and government support.
          <br><br>
          This is the platform to set a good standard of living in all our community. Fair therefore seeks to harness the potential of all these stakeholders to build affordable low cost accommodation for the deprived community. The foundation will develop prototype low building schemes which will be funded by the wealth generating and employment scheme of the Foundation.

        <p class="heading text-left">EMPLOYMENT</p>
        <p class='rd-def par text-left'>
          The rate of unemployment, especially among the youth in Africa countries is well over of the international average. The information below is a stark reality of the situation.
          <br><br>
          “In Africa, 200 million people are aged between 15 and 24 years, comprising more than 20% of the population. Africa’s population is growing fast and is experiencing a slow demographic transition, which will increase the pressure countries face with job creation. The large majority of the youth lives in rural areas and is mostly employed in agriculture, for which they account for 65% of total employment. Young people are, however, not an homogeneous group and their employment prospects vary according to several factors ranging from region to gender to schooling, thus requiring different policy interventions.”
          <br><br>
          There are no easy solutions to the problem of youth unemployment. Youth employment has to be part of the growth strategy of every African country. Employment policies need to favour investment in education and training. Youth employment has to be part of the growth strategy of every African country. Youth in urban areas are looking for jobs alongside thousands of others from the same schools, while rural youth are flooding into the cities looking for work,” said Sanoussi Toure, the Minister of Finance of Mali. “This is a tragedy. Our policies favour investment in education and training, but this investment has not led to job creation.”
          <br><br>
          Kinuthia Murugu, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Kenya, concurred that economic growth does not equal job creation, “which is why we need specific targeted interventions.”
          <br><br>
          FAIR has realized this reality and mapped out programs and projects to tackle employment in general and youth employment in particular. We intend to draw up a youth training and employment program for the youth and unemployed through our local and regional cells, getting the youth, the local and central government together with all stakeholders to draw up training and job creation programs to get the youth, especially the rural youth into local employment instead of migrating into cities.
          <br><br>
          FAIR through our agricultural and construction program will ensure employment for the youth. For us employment offers engagement for the youth and provides a basis for demonstrating the inherent integrity within them since when they realize their potential from the engagement in work, their creative potential will be released into more positive activity.

        <p class="heading text-left">HEALTH</p>
        <p class='rd-def par text-left'>
          The Health of a people is determinant of it well being or otherwise. Furthermore the health of a nation determines its productive capacity. A World Health Organisation (WHO) report on the heath delivery system of Africa paints a bleak picture:
          <br><br>
          “The challenges are many, including: weak and fragmented health systems; inadequate resources for scaling up proven interventions; limited access to the health services and technologies that are available; poor management of human resources for health; recurrent natural and man- made disasters and emergencies; and extreme poverty.”
          <br><br>
          The continent is beset with numerous preventable diseases which can be tackled given communal awareness and participation. The main problem is that government s have either not given it the priority that it deserves or have not got communal involvement in drawing up health delivery programs that affect the community.
          <br><br>
          Foundation for African Integrity does not claim to be capable of addressing these issues, but it is hope that given communal goodwill and participation, the impact of health risks to the population of Africa could be reduced.
          <br><br>
          Through our community based health program, we intend to complement government policies and programs on health by training the youth to embark on basic health education campaigns on the prevention of certain diseases, help in the procurement and supply of essential medicines, raise funds for the building of delivery points for primary health care such as health canters and help in the training of those already in the provision of local and traditional health systems.
